/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  OfficeRoom — one running instance of the office
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A Room is a server-side container for a group of clients sharing one OfficeState.
 * Colyseus calls the lifecycle hooks below for us:
 *   onCreate() → once, when the room instance is first created.
 *   onJoin()   → each time a client is accepted into the room.
 *   onLeave()  → each time a client disconnects.
 *   onMessage()→ registered handlers fire when a client sends that message type.
 *
 * THE SERVER TICK (what happens "for free", and the one exception)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * For HUMANS this is a pure relay: we mutate state only in response to "move"
 * messages (relay model — see OfficeState). Colyseus runs its own patch loop
 * (~20 Hz by default): every tick it diffs the state, encodes the binary deltas,
 * and broadcasts them to all clients. That's the third "clock" of the system; our
 * job is just to keep OfficeState correct.
 *
 * THE ONE EXCEPTION (F2): an AI NPC has no client sending "move", so we add a
 * single server-driven simulation tick (`setSimulationInterval` below) that lets
 * the NpcController advance the NPC's position. It is the only state we mutate
 * without a client message; humans stay pure relay. See NpcController for the why.
